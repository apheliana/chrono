# Chrono

This project aims people to make their own lists like the "Articles I've read" or "Movies I've watched".
- You can see your lists by clicking 'Your lists' on the 'Home' page. (If you have any)
<br><space><space>* List name - Description - Total number of entries 
- You can create lists on the '/lists' page by clicking 'Create a list'.
- You can see and add entries by clicking the list name on 'lists' page.
<br><space><space>* Entry name - Date you read/watched... it.
- You can update the list and entries on the 'list/id' page.

A local storage file called '@forCrowd/chrono/data' would be created as a temporary database when you first created a list.
